Chatbot for MYCOLLEGE
Introduction
This project is a conversational Chatbot designed to provide quick and accurate responses to common queries related to MYCOLLEGE. The chatbot leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Seq2Seq model to handle user inputs effectively, supporting intent recognition, context retention, and dynamic responses.

Features
Course Details: Provides a list of available courses and their fees.
Fee Structure: Offers detailed information on semester fees, hostel charges, and scholarships.
Admission Guidance: Lists documents required for admission and guides users through the process.
Hostel Information: Shares details about hostel facilities, fees, and distance from campus.
Event Information: Lists upcoming college events like tech fests, cultural programs, and alumni meets.
Location Assistance: Provides a clickable map link to the college's address.
Customizable: Easy to modify intents, responses, and datasets.
How It Works
Input Processing:

User inputs are preprocessed using tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
Intent Recognition:

Employs NLP techniques and fuzzy matching to identify user intents based on pre-trained datasets (e.g., intents.json).
Response Generation:

A Seq2Seq model maps user queries to relevant responses.
Responses can include links, dynamic data, or predefined answers.
Context Retention:

Tracks previous user queries to provide contextual replies for multi-turn conversations.
Technologies Used
Backend:
Python 3.x
Flask: For API and web server integration.
TensorFlow/Keras: For the Seq2Seq chatbot model.
NLTK & SpaCy: For text preprocessing and NLP tasks.
FuzzyWuzzy: For fuzzy matching and handling user typos.
Frontend:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For the user interface.
Bootstrap: For responsive design.
Database:
intents.json: Stores the intents and responses for the chatbot.
